# Security Scanning - Quick Start

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Run full build with security scan
mvn verify

# Run security scan only (after building)
./security-scan.sh

# Skip security scan (not recommended)
mvn verify -Dexec.skip=true
```

## 📊 What Gets Scanned?

1. ✅ **Maven Dependencies** (`pom.xml`)
2. ✅ **JAR Artifact** (`target/*.jar`)
3. ✅ **Docker Image** (`solarman-backend:latest`)

## 🔴 Build Behavior

- Build **FAILS** on **CRITICAL** vulnerabilities
- Build **PASSES** on HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW vulnerabilities (logged only)
